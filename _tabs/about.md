# Hi, I'm Ivan 

This blog is my digital learning journal:
a record of what I’ve picked up, where I’ve stumbled, and how I plan to move forward.

## Why am I doing this?

I’m looking to carve out a path into the IT industry in Japan. The world is shifting ever more towards tech, and I want to be part of this wave — to not just watch from the sidelines, but actually contribute and build something meaningful in this field.

## However......

I don’t have a traditional background in IT. While I’ve attened online courses before (alas, many of them ended up unfinished). This time, I’m determined to see it through.

## What’s my plan?

I’ve given myself a year and a half for learning — to pick up the skills needed to become a technician, and then, step by step, work towards being a networking engineer. 

## What will it take?
 - Hands-on experience: Not just theory, but real practice — whether it’s home labs, side projects, or open-source contributions.
 - Certifications: To boost my confidence and prove my skills to myself (and potential employers).
 - Consistency: Making sure I show up every day, even if progress feels slow.
 - Documenting everything: Sharing my journey here — the wins, the setbacks, the resources I find helpful, and the things I wish I knew earlier.

If you’re on a similar path, or just curious about learning IT from scratch, I hope this blog will be useful, or at least relatable.
